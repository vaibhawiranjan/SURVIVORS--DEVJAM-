    <h2>How Friends & Family Can Support</h2><br>

    The traditional joint family that exists in India is seen as a source of social and economic support and is known
    for its tolerance of deviant behavior and capacity to absorb additional roles in times of crisis.<br>What does it
    mean to have a supportive network of family and friends?
    Having a supportive network of family and friends does not mean that one should seek to make as many friends as
    possible for the sake of doing so. Instead, one should strive to focus on the several important relationships with a
    handful of people in their social circle and strengthen these relationships.<br>
    Why is it important to have a supportive network of family and friends?
    After our basic physiological (air, water etc) and safety needs (safe neighbourhood, job security etc) are met, the
    next stage is to fulfil our social needs. We need to feel a sense of belonging to a larger social group and feel
    socially connected to our family and friends.
    Different people bring out different aspects of our personalities and fulfil different roles in our lives. For
    example, an extroverted friend may bring out the party animal in you whenever you are in the mood to have fun and
    celebrate, whereas, another friend who is quiet and loyal can be a good listener when you need to talk about your
    problems. Different people can also help us to see the same problem in different ways. This gives us a more complete
    picture of the situation.

  <p style="text-align:center"><b>While there are many different ways that people can support one another, much research
      has been done on the effects of four distinct types of social support:</b><br>-</p>

        <p><span style="font-size:36px"> “Even a flower cannot blossom without sunshine.”</span> This type of support
          often involves physical comfort such as hugs or pats on the back, as well as listening and empathizing. With
          emotional support, a friend or spouse might give you a big hug and listen to your problems, letting you know
          that they've felt the same way, too.</p>

        <p><span style="font-size:36px">“Anyone who ever gave you confidence, you owe them a lot.”</span>This type of
          social support is shown in expressions of confidence or encouragement. Someone offering esteem support might
          point out the strengths you’re forgetting you have, or just let you know that they believe in you. Life
          coaches and many therapists offer this type of support to let their clients know that they believe in them;
          this often leads to clients believing in themselves more.</p>

          responsibilities for someone else so they can deal with a problem or in other ways taking an active stance to
          help someone manage a problem they’re experiencing. Someone who offers you tangible support may bring you
          dinner when you’re sick, help you brainstorm solutions (rather than telling you what you should do, as with
          informational support), or in other ways help you actively deal with the issue at hand.</p>
