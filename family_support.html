        The traditional joint family that exists in India is seen as a source of
        social and economic support and is known for its tolerance of deviant
        behavior and capacity to absorb additional roles in times of crisis.<br />What
        does it mean to have a supportive network of family and friends? Having
        a supportive network of family and friends does not mean that one should
        seek to make as many friends as possible for the sake of doing so.
        Instead, one should strive to focus on the several important
        relationships with a handful of people in their social circle and
        strengthen these relationships.<br />
        Why is it important to have a supportive network of family and friends?
        After our basic physiological (air, water etc) and safety needs (safe
        neighbourhood, job security etc) are met, the next stage is to fulfil
        our social needs. We need to feel a sense of belonging to a larger
        social group and feel socially connected to our family and friends.
        Different people bring out different aspects of our personalities and
        fulfil different roles in our lives. For example, an extroverted friend
        may bring out the party animal in you whenever you are in the mood to
        have fun and celebrate, whereas, another friend who is quiet and loyal
        can be a good listener when you need to talk about your problems.
        Different people can also help us to see the same problem in different
        ways. This gives us a more complete picture of the situation.

              This type of support often involves physical comfort such as hugs
              or pats on the back, as well as listening and empathizing. With
              emotional support, a friend or spouse might give you a big hug and
              listen to your problems, letting you know that they've felt the
              same way, too.

              advice-giving, or in gathering and sharing information that can
              help people know of potential next steps that may work well.

              the strengths you’re forgetting you have, or just let you know
              that they believe in you. Life coaches and many therapists offer
              this type of support to let their clients know that they believe
              in them; this often leads to clients believing in themselves more.

              than telling you what you should do, as with informational
