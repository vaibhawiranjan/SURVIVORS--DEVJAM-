  <h2 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px">The Benefits of Being Mentally Healthy</h2>

  <div class="newspaper">
    When we talk about mental health, we typically refer to our cognitive, behavioral, and emotional wellbeing.

    Moreover, while being mentally healthy is sometimes considered the absence of mental disorders, it is perhaps more
    beneficial and more accurate to see it as learning to flourish (Felman & Tee-Melegrito, 2022; Seligman, 2011).

    Martin Seligman, often referred to as the father of positive psychology, proposes that removing clients’ sadness,
    anxiety, or anger does not make them mentally healthy (Seligman, 2011).

    Indeed, even when the therapeutic work is done, it may not lead to a happy patient. Instead, according to Seligman,
    positive mental health is the presence of positive emotions, engagement, good relationships, meaning, and
    accomplishment (Seligman, 2011).

    The World Health Organization (WHO), therefore, describes mental health as “a state of mental wellbeing that enables
    people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their
    community” (WHO, 2022, para. 1).

    According to the WHO, mental health is of positive value, integral to our wellness, and underpins our ability to
    shape our lives and our world.

    Mental health is such a fundamental human need that it is considered a basic human right (WHO, 2022).

          them down if you can, because they can be easy to forget. Then reflect on them later if your mood is in need

          hours before bedtime. Consider reading or listening to relaxing music instead.</p>
